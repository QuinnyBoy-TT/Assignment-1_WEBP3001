    <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                There is currently no existing business management system, all the information collected are simply
                paper based, it can be easily unreliable, and all the stored information can easily be lost if it is
                treated carelessly as has happened before. The software technology is meant to replace paper-based
                storage of information as well as to become a way of advertising and managing a corporation. The
                technology system was designed with a web-based environment in mind because it addresses a
                hardware-restricted company, as the current company is small, buying new hardware equipment will be
                pointless, as in a computer network. To reduce the burden on the existing system by relieving the bulk
                of processes from the current system's lack of processing capacity.

<h3>Long Term Goals</h3>
<p>
Long term planning would be the ease in scalability and the easy implementation of an e-commerce section of the business due to the use of current technology such as React/Django.
Short-Term Goals
Short term planning would be the immediate implementation of a system as there is none currently. With the ability to perform CRUD operations amongst staff or webmasters.

<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>Currently the small business has no form of communicating their menu items and pictures of their items other than an Instagram page. A Web Based platform would be an appropriate outlet to advertise products produced by the business. This refers to any program that is accessed over a network using HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol). Web based applications often run inside a web browser. We can often say that web-based application is user based as we can download some part of the application to view it on the desktop. Said Web Based Platform would provide an efficient way of data insertion and data manipulation. In addition to this technology utilized a database can be implemented to increase the dynamic behavior of the platform. The platform becomes dynamic due to apiâ€™s working in conjunction with a framework passing and calling data meaning efficient and elegant transmission of data without the wasting of limited resources.</p>
